# 🌳 Advanced Git Mastery Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for developers who already know **basic Git commands** (clone, commit, push, pull, branch, merge) and want to **master Git** for team collaboration, open-source contributions, and large-scale software projects.  

It covers **intermediate to advanced Git concepts**, best practices, workflows, and real-world exercises.  

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Strengthen Git Fundamentals (Intermediate → Advanced)

**🎯 Goal:** Move beyond basic Git usage and understand how Git really works under the hood.

### Topics
- Git Internals
  - How Git stores data (objects, trees, commits, refs)  
  - The `.git` folder structure  
  - Staging area vs working directory vs repository  
- Branching & Merging
  - Fast-forward vs recursive merges  
  - Merge conflicts and resolution strategies  
- Git Logs & History
  - `git log` with advanced formatting  
  - `git show`, `git diff`, `git blame`  
- Reset, Revert, and Checkout
  - Soft vs mixed vs hard resets  
  - When to use revert instead of reset  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *Pro Git* – Scott Chacon & Ben Straub (free online)  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Create a repo, simulate conflicts, and resolve them  
  - Practice resetting commits safely  
  - Explore `.git/objects` manually

## ⚡ Phase 2: Advanced Git Techniques

**🎯 Goal:** Learn advanced branching, rewriting history, and debugging.

### Topics
- Rebasing
  - Interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`)  
  - Squashing & reordering commits  
  - Fixing up messy commit history  
- Cherry-Picking
  - Applying commits across branches  
- Stashing
  - Managing WIP changes (`git stash`, `git stash pop`)  
- Advanced Diff & Patch
  - `git apply` and patch files  
- Debugging with Git
  - `git bisect` for bug hunting  
  - `git blame` with context  

### Recommended Resources
- **Tutorials**  
  - [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Rewrite a messy commit history into clean commits  
  - Use `git bisect` to locate a buggy commit  
  - Simulate hotfix cherry-pick from production branch

## 🌐 Phase 3: Team Collaboration & Workflows

**🎯 Goal:** Master Git in collaborative, team, and open-source environments.

### Topics
- Collaboration Basics
  - Pull requests (PRs) and code reviews  
  - Forking workflows for open-source projects  
- Branching Models
  - Git Flow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based Development  
- Tags & Releases
  - Lightweight vs annotated tags  
  - Release versioning strategies  
- Submodules & Monorepos
  - Adding and updating submodules  
  - Pros/cons of submodules vs monorepo  

### Recommended Resources
- **Book**  
  - *Git Pocket Guide* – Richard Silverman  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Simulate Git Flow in a demo project  
  - Create annotated tags for release versions  
  - Fork and contribute to an open-source project

## 🏆 Phase 4: Advanced Git Power User

**🎯 Goal:** Become an expert capable of handling complex repositories, large-scale projects, and custom Git tooling.

### Topics
- Hooks & Automation
  - Client-side hooks (pre-commit, pre-push)  
  - Server-side hooks for CI/CD pipelines  
- Large Scale Repos
  - Git LFS (Large File Storage)  
  - Handling monorepos efficiently  
- Security & Policies
  - Signing commits with GPG  
  - Enforcing commit message standards  
- Customization
  - Git aliases for productivity  
  - Custom merge strategies  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *Mastering Git* – Jakub Narębski  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Configure commit signing with GPG  
  - Set up Git hooks for linting before commits  
  - Experiment with Git LFS for large datasets

## 💡 General Tips

- Use `git status` often to avoid mistakes.  
- Prefer **rebasing before merging** in feature branches for clean history.  
- Use `git reflog` as a "safety net" for recovering lost commits.  
- Write meaningful commit messages (follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).  
- Practice on **toy repositories** before applying advanced techniques to production.
