# 🐬 Advanced SQL (MySQL) Mastery Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for developers who already understand **basic SQL (CRUD operations, simple joins, basic constraints)** and want to **master MySQL** for production systems, performance optimization, and large-scale applications.  

It covers **intermediate to advanced SQL concepts**, MySQL-specific features, best practices, and real-world projects.  

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Strengthen SQL Core (Intermediate → Advanced)

**🎯 Goal:** Go beyond SELECT/INSERT and understand relational design, constraints, and deeper query capabilities.

### Topics
- Advanced Joins
  - LEFT/RIGHT joins  
  - CROSS joins, SELF joins  
- Subqueries
  - Correlated vs non-correlated  
  - Inline views (derived tables)  
- Data Integrity
  - Constraints (CHECK, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY)  
  - Cascading deletes & updates  
- Set Operations
  - UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT  
- Window Functions
  - `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `NTILE`  
  - Running totals, moving averages  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *SQL for Smarties* – Joe Celko  
  - *Learning SQL* – Alan Beaulieu  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Build a **student grading system** with advanced queries  
  - Create **leaderboards with RANK/DENSE_RANK**  
  - Analyze **sales data with moving averages**

## ⚡ Phase 2: MySQL-Specific Mastery

**🎯 Goal:** Learn MySQL’s unique features, engine behavior, and tuning.

### Topics
- MySQL Architecture
  - Storage engines (InnoDB vs MyISAM vs MEMORY)

  - Buffer pool, redo/undo logs  
- Indexing
  - B-Tree vs Hash indexes  
  - Covering indexes  
  - Composite indexes & index cardinality  
  - Indexing strategies for performance  
- Transactions & Isolation
  - ACID in MySQL  
  - Isolation levels (READ UNCOMMITTED → SERIALIZABLE)  
  - Deadlocks and handling  
- Views & CTEs
  - Recursive CTEs  
  - When to use views vs materialized tables  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *High Performance MySQL* – Baron Schwartz, Peter Zaitsev, Vadim Tkachenko  
- **Tutorials**  
  - [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) (official, very practical)  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Design a **banking system with transactions & rollback**  
  - Optimize queries with **indexes and EXPLAIN**  
  - Experiment with **different isolation levels** in a simulated ticket-booking system

## 🌐 Phase 3: Query Optimization & Performance Tuning

**🎯 Goal:** Learn to optimize queries and handle large-scale datasets.

### Topics
- Query Optimization
  - `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`  
  - Query execution plans  
  - Common performance pitfalls (SELECT *, implicit conversions)  
- Partitioning & Sharding
  - Horizontal vs vertical partitioning  
  - Range, list, hash partitioning  
- Advanced Indexing
  - Full-text search indexes  
  - Spatial indexes (GIS)  
- Caching & Scaling
  - Query caching strategies  
  - Read replicas & master-slave replication  

### Recommended Resources
- **Book:** *SQL Performance Explained* – Markus Winand  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Optimize a **reporting dashboard with millions of rows**  
  - Build a **log analysis system** with partitioned tables  
  - Implement a **replication setup (master-slave)** in MySQL

## 🏆 Phase 4: Advanced Topics & Real-World Applications

**🎯 Goal:** Apply MySQL knowledge to enterprise-level systems and advanced features.

### Topics
- Stored Procedures & Functions
  - Pros & cons in modern apps  
  - Error handling inside procedures  
- Triggers & Events
  - Auditing tables with triggers  
  - Scheduled tasks with MySQL events  
- Security
  - User management & roles  
  - Encryption functions & SSL  
- MySQL in Distributed Systems
  - Replication (statement vs row-based)  
  - Group replication & clustering  
  - Backup & recovery strategies  
- NoSQL in MySQL
  - JSON data type  
  - Generated columns & indexes on JSON  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *MySQL Cookbook* – Paul DuBois  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Build an **audit log system with triggers**  
  - Create a **reporting warehouse with materialized views**  
  - Develop a **real-time analytics system using replication**  
  - Implement a **hybrid SQL+JSON data store**  

---

## 💡 General Tips

- Use `EXPLAIN` on all non-trivial queries.  
- Regularly analyze `slow_query_log`.  
- Benchmark queries with realistic data.  
- Normalize for integrity, denormalize for performance.  
- Document schema design decisions.
