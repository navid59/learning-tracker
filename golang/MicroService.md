# 🕸️ Advanced Microservices in Go – Mastery Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for developers who already have a good understanding of Go and want to **master microservices architecture**.  

It covers **intermediate to advanced concepts**, including service design, communication, resilience, DevOps integration, observability, and real-world scaling patterns.  

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Microservices Fundamentals with Go

**🎯 Goal:** Understand the microservices mindset and build simple, independent services in Go.

### Topics
- Microservices vs Monoliths
  - Pros & cons, trade-offs  
  - When to choose microservices  
- Service Design
  - Bounded contexts & domain-driven design (DDD)  
  - Service contracts and APIs  
- REST APIs in Go
  - `net/http`, `gorilla/mux`, `chi`  
  - Middleware design  
  - JSON & error handling  
- Configuration & Environment Management
  - `viper` for config  
  - Environment variables & 12-factor principles  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *Building Microservices* – Sam Newman  
- **Tutorials**  
  - [Go by Example – Web](https://gobyexample.com/http-servers)  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Build a **user management service (CRUD + REST)**  
  - Add a **configurable logging system**  

---

## ⚡ Phase 2: Service-to-Service Communication

**🎯 Goal:** Learn inter-service communication patterns and Go tools for APIs and messaging.

### Topics
- REST vs gRPC
  - Designing APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger  
  - gRPC + Protocol Buffers in Go  
- Messaging
  - Async communication with RabbitMQ, NATS, or Kafka  
  - Event-driven microservices  
- Service Discovery
  - DNS-based discovery  
  - Tools: Consul, etcd  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *Microservices in Go* – Matthew Campbell  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Build **two services (user + orders) communicating via REST**  
  - Convert the communication to **gRPC**  
  - Add **event-driven notifications with RabbitMQ**  

---

## 🌐 Phase 3: Resilience, Scaling, and Observability

**🎯 Goal:** Make microservices production-ready with resiliency patterns and observability.

### Topics
- Resilience Patterns
  - Circuit breakers (resilience4go, custom)  
  - Retries, timeouts, backoff strategies  
  - Bulkheads & rate limiting  
- Observability
  - Logging (Zap, Logrus)  
  - Metrics with Prometheus + Grafana  
  - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry + Jaeger  
- API Gateways
  - Kong, Ambassador, NGINX Ingress  
  - Authentication & rate limiting  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *Release It!* – Michael T. Nygard  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Add **retry + timeout logic** to a gRPC service  
  - Integrate **Prometheus metrics & Grafana dashboards**  
  - Implement **distributed tracing across 3 services**  

---

## 🏆 Phase 4: Deployment, CI/CD, and Advanced Patterns

**🎯 Goal:** Learn how to deploy and manage microservices in production.

### Topics
- Containers & Orchestration
  - Dockerizing Go services  
  - Kubernetes (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets)  
- CI/CD
  - GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for pipelines  
  - Canary deployments & rolling updates  
- Advanced Patterns
  - Saga pattern for distributed transactions  
  - Event sourcing + CQRS  
  - Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *Cloud Native Go* – Mina Andrawos  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Deploy services to **Kubernetes with Helm**  
  - Implement **Saga pattern for multi-service transactions**  
  - Add a **service mesh for traffic management**  

---

## 💡 General Tips

- Start small: build a few services, then expand.  
- Follow **12-factor app principles**.  
- Write **contract tests** for service boundaries.  
- Automate everything: CI/CD, tests, deployments.  
- Observe everything: logs, metrics, traces.

Happy Scaling! 🎉
