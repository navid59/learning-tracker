# 🐹 GoLang Mastery Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for developers who already have some hands-on experience with Go (e.g., a few small projects) but want to **deepen their understanding** and eventually **master Go programming**.  

It covers **intermediate to advanced topics**, recommended **resources**, and **practice projects** to help you grow from a casual Go user into a confident Go developer who can design and build production-grade systems independently.  

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Strengthen Core Go Knowledge (Intermediate Level)

**🎯 Goal:** Solidify Go syntax, idioms, and standard library usage, and reduce reliance on AI or tutorials.

### Topics
- Go Fundamentals
  - Variables, constants, functions, methods, interfaces  
  - Structs, embedding, error handling idioms  
  - Packages & modules (`go mod`)  
- Collections & Algorithms
  - Slices, arrays, maps, strings  
  - Sorting, searching, basic data manipulation  
- Pointers & Memory Management
  - `new` vs `make`, structs, memory allocation  
  - Garbage collection basics  
- Idiomatic Go
  - [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)  
  - Naming conventions, `defer`, error handling patterns  

### Recommended Resources
- **Books**  
  - *The Go Programming Language* – Alan Donovan & Brian Kernighan  
  - *Go in Action* – William Kennedy  
- **Tutorials**  
  - [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)  
  - [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)  
- **Practice Projects**
  - CLI To-Do List App  
  - JSON Parser / Serializer  
  - Simple File Server with `net/http`  
  - [Exercism Go Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/go) problems

## ⚡ Phase 2: Concurrency and Advanced Go Patterns

**🎯 Goal:** Master Go’s biggest strength — concurrency and channel-based programming.

### Topics
- Goroutines & Channels
  - Buffered vs unbuffered channels  
  - Channel direction, `select`, timeouts  
  - Worker pool patterns  
- Concurrency Patterns
  - Fan-in, fan-out, pipelines  
  - Cancellation with `context.Context`  
- Advanced Error Handling
  - Custom error types  
  - Wrapping errors, `panic` & `recover`  
- Testing & Profiling
  - Unit tests (`testing`), benchmarks  
  - Code coverage, CPU/memory profiling  

### Recommended Resources
- **Book:** *Concurrency in Go* – Katherine Cox-Buday  
- **Blog:** [Go Blog: Concurrency is not Parallelism](https://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism)  
- **Practice Projects**
  - Concurrent Web Scraper  
  - Producer–Consumer System  
  - Rate-Limited API Client  
  - [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) challenges

- Dependency Management
  - `go mod` deep dive, vendoring  
- Performance & Profiling
  - Benchmarking, garbage collection tuning  
- Advanced Patterns
  - Interfaces, dependency injection, reflection  
  - Generics (Go 1.18+)  
  - Logging, configuration management  

### Recommended Resources

## 🏆 Phase 4: Mastery & Ecosystem Expertise

**🎯 Goal:** Become an expert who can architect large-scale systems, contribute to libraries, and teach Go.

### Topics
- Advanced System Programming
  - Networking (TCP/UDP), file I/O  
  - Goroutine scheduling internals  
- Generics & Type Constraints
  - Generic data structures & algorithms  
- Go Tools & Ecosystem
  - `fmt`, `vet`, `lint`, `pprof`, `trace`, `generate`  
  - Dependency injection libraries (wire, fx)  
- Open Source & Community
  - Contribute to Go libraries  
  - Explore Cobra, Viper, Zap, GORM  

### Practice Projects
- Distributed Job Scheduler  
- High-Performance HTTP Proxy  
- Your Own Go Library (well-documented & tested)  
- Contributions to Open Source Projects

## 💡 General Tips

- **Code Daily:** Write even small snippets to reinforce concepts.  
- **Read Go Code:** Study open-source Go projects to see idiomatic patterns.  
- **Write Tests:** Adopt TDD or at least write good unit tests.  
- **Teach Others:** Blog posts, talks, and tutorials deepen your understanding.
